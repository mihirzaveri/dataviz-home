	<h1 id="title">Dataviz: Fall 2013</h1>
	<h2 id="subhead">Here's some work that I did in the UC Berkeley Journalism School's data visualization class in fall 2013, taught by Shan Carter and Kevin Quealy of the NY Times.</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://mihirzaveri.github.io/bar-chart/">A Bar Chart in D3: Recreating NY Times Piece on ESPN's Dominance</a>
			<p>Made a bar chart in R and then D3 recreating <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/sports/ncaafootball/to-defend-its-empire-espn-stays-on-offensive.html#g-histogram">this NY Times bar chart</a> on ESPN network's relative monthly price.</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://mihirzaveri.github.io/line-chart/">An Interactive Line Chart in D3: Recreating NY Times' Strikeouts Graphic</a>
			<p>Another recreation (rather attempted recreation) of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html">NY Times graphic</a>, this time with interactivity (click on a team and the line will change).</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://mihirzaveri.github.io/maps-intro/">Intro to Mapping With R</a>
			<p>A mapping exercise using a California county shapefile and joining it with state demographic data to show the percent Hispanic population per county. Also my first lesson in saving my R code, never to be forgotten.</p></li>
		<li><a href="http://mihirzaveri.github.io/crime-exercise/">A Breaking News Exercise: Origins of Chicago's Guns</a>
			<p>We did a "quick" (nowhere close to breaking news quick) exercise using a dataset that listed by county where guns recovered in Chicago came from. The link above is the result of the R code, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/mihirzaveri/7244083">here is the code itself.</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://mihirzaveri.github.io/final-project/">Final Project</a>
			<p>We spent some of the final weeks in class reporting and producing our own final project. I chose to focus mine on missed votes in Congress, particularly testing the assumption that legislators prioritize campaigning over making law. Lots of R and D3 went into this, <a href="https://gist.github.com/mihirzaveri/8016606">link to R code.</a></p></li>
